👋 Hello World! (and Github community), I’m Henrique!

👀 I’m interested in new technologies, business challenges and innovative solutions.

🤿 I’m currently deep diving into Ruby on Rails, HTML 5, CSS, Javascript and SQL, to further develop the knowledge gained on Le Wagon's Bootcamp.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require any of the above languages.

📫 You can reach me through my email (henrique.mf@gmail.com) or linkedIn (linkedin.com/in/henrique-de-mello-franco/).
